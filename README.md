# njals-memory-game

Just moving Njals memory game on to github and creating a README

# small note. 

I'll recommend you to download (cursor)[https://www.cursor.com/] for development. It's a great editor. At least for now

I take it you have python3 installer, i reference it as python, but you can use python3 if you have no alias.


# How to run
```bash
   # create the virtaual environment with python 
   # at the time of writing this was 3.13.0
  python -m venv env

  # switch to the new environment
  source env/bin/activate

  # install all dependencies in this environment (none at the moment)
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
